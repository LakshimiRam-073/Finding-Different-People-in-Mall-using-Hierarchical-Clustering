# Hierarchical Clustering

The way a Machine can split the datas into different splits.
This Comes under [Unsupervised](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/unsupervised-learning#:~:text=Unsupervised%20learning%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20need%20for%20human%20intervention.) learning.<br>

There are many [algorithms](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/unsupervised-learning#:~:text=Unsupervised%20learning%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20need%20for%20human%20intervention.) wich can classify a specific data to clusters.
<br>
This process is called as [Clustering]().

In this program I have used a algorithm called [Hierarchical Clustering](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/unsupervised-learning#:~:text=Unsupervised%20learning%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20need%20for%20human%20intervention.), Which can cluster with the help of [Dendograms](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/unsupervised-learning#:~:text=Unsupervised%20learning%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20need%20for%20human%20intervention.)

## Dendograms

Dendograms are basically a graph wich will tell the distances between two clusters.

At first it is being constructed by  a single object as a cluster and later it begins with other near one with [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) and later on it clusters with other groups until to form  a final cluster.

You can use different distances such as [Hamming distance](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance#:~:text=Hamming%20distance%20is%20a%20metric,d(a%2Cb).) , [Levenshtein distance](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance#:~:text=Hamming%20distance%20is%20a%20metric,d(a%2Cb).) ,etc...
